# BLUE ALERTS — Cumulative Evolution Log

This log distinguishes runtime integration, static checks, browser rendering, CI simulation, native desktop interaction and physical Android validation.

## Cycle 5 — V94 industrial logistics environment

- Base: `1b0768b56bc61976391bc6fd930faa3a336e2e7c` on `main` (2026-11-02).
- Branch: `feat/blue-alerts-industrial-yard-runtime-20261102`.
- Runtime: integrated four authored, non-blocking environment clusters into the existing V94 Three.js scene:
  - Electrical substation with three transformers, insulators, switchgear and perimeter fence.
  - Loading gantry with braced legs, crossbeam, trolley, hoist and hazard markings.
  - Three ribbed fuel silos with ladders, warning plates and transfer pipe.
  - Cargo apron with 18 instanced, color-varied crates and 8 instanced hazard barrels.
- Performance choices: cached shared box/cylinder geometry; instancing for repeated cargo; desktop-only shadow casting; no external assets, downloads or paid services.
- Gameplay safety: all clusters and props are tagged `blocksMovement:false`; four clearance zones exclude the substation, gantry, silos and cargo apron from deterministic scrub, tree and rock placement. Placement and pathfinding systems remain unchanged.
- Regression coverage: desktop and 390x844 mobile browser assertions for runtime diagnostics, cluster count, instanced counts and non-blocking flag. A dedicated desktop camera focus captures the gantry as visual evidence.
- Static validator: source-contract checks for each cluster and instanced set; existing inline-script syntax validation remains active.

### Exact commits

- Runtime gantry detail and visible placement: `0ee7683c25db9579ad0f1d5b7212fd6764183e2e`.
- Browser assertions and visual capture: `365fb1c12983ba5a432de02c499a68ab65bfb886`.
- Browser clearance coverage: `f77c19465df495cfb2d4abdaae470768796e7b0c`.
- Browser camera-focus ordering fix: `e037a0563e945cb2c061babeb5052fc6519a627a` (attempted frame wait; still failed because focus/reset disturbed the next projection assertion).
- Browser final capture ordering: `0a2d7e54264714be9443bec14cc9f46d56a2de7d` (industrial screenshot moved after all camera-sensitive gameplay checks).
- Static validator: `c55c6a5b53aed560c9fa6698135d0d610efb6aa5`; clearance assertions: `6a2f6f9b109c01d3df9b5275f1e3a0afa2a8c81e`.
- This log is updated after the source and test commits.

### Evidence boundary
- Main baseline commit `1b0768b56bc61976391bc6fd930faa3a336e2e7c` passed desktop/mobile WebGL, standalone V94 build, OpenRTS build, 12/12 native scenario movement, and native left-click selection/right-click move and attack in workflow `41368243696`.
- Mission objectives PR #28 head `ff40bfc1500c1164fd31f0650431c758578e1e93` passed workflow `41370139368`, including desktop/mobile browser rendering, standalone HTML build, OpenRTS build and interactive native input. PR #28 remains separate and draft.
- First browser attempt on PR head `faecb959b5acc73c79ff1621d8ef779a6a2b003c` rendered and saved both the normal gameplay and gantry screenshots, then failed in the existing build-placement test because the camera had not advanced a frame after the visual-focus reset. The gantry screenshot was inspected; the failure was a test-camera synchronization issue, not a reported WebGL or runtime exception. The first correction added a frame wait but still failed. The robust correction moves the gantry screenshot to the end of the desktop sequence, after all construction/combat projection assertions, so the visual focus never mutates the camera before gameplay tests. A fresh exact-head CI run is required after this ordering change.
- CI mobile emulation is not a physical Samsung test. No physical Android device test is claimed.
- The OpenRTS screenshot is a separate native engine smoke test; it is not evidence that the V94 HTML scene and OpenRTS are one merged runtime.


## Cycle 5 — final verification

- Exact tested PR head: `5d0fd9ad3c17447f6c29094a01fd50446c1e3b14`.
- GitHub Actions workflow: [`41372113986`](https://github.com/Ascameleon/Blue-alert/actions/runs/41372113986) — **success**.
- Static V94 HTML validation, model-kit validation, scenario XML validation and standalone playable HTML build: passed.
- Playwright desktop and 390x844 mobile browser tests: passed. Coverage included WebGL startup, build-zone placement/rejection, combat projectile impacts, unit death/explosion lifecycle, building damage stages, mobile layout/touch targets, environment cluster diagnostics and mobile cleanup performance.
- OpenRTS build: passed.
- OpenRTS scenario smoke test: 12/12 units moved.
- Native input smoke test: real left-click selection, right-click movement and right-click attack each produced verified state changes.
- Visual artifact: `openrts-graphical-smoke-test` (artifact `13109696371`); inspected `v94-browser/desktop-v94-industrial-yard.png` and `v94-browser/mobile-v94-gameplay-390x844.png`.
- Standalone playable build: `blue-alerts-v94-build-zone-playable` (artifact `13109258207`); extracted and verified as `BLUE_ALERTS_V94_BUILD_ZONE_JOUABLE.html`.
- The mobile cleanup measurement was 33.8 FPS in the CI-emulated 390x844 browser scenario only. It is not a full-game sustained FPS claim and does not substitute for a physical Samsung test.
- The OpenRTS graphical/input smoke test remains a separate native engine test; it does not imply that the V94 HTML runtime has been ported into OpenRTS.
- PR #29 remains open and draft; no merge to `main` was performed.
